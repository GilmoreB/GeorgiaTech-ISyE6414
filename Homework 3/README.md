**Background**
The fishing industry uses numerous measurements to describe a specific fish. Our goal is to predict the weight of a fish based on a number of these measurements and determine if any of these measurements are insignificant in determining the weight of a product. See below for the description of these measurements.

**Data Description**

Weight: weight of fish in g (numerical) <br />
Species: species name of fish (categorical) <br />
Body.Height: height of body of fish in cm (numerical) <br />
Total.Length: length of fish from mouth to tail in cm (numerical) <br />
Diagonal.Length: length of diagonal of main body of fish in cm (numerical) <br />
Height: height of head of fish in cm (numerical) <br />
Width: width of head of fish in cm (numerical) <br />

**Question 1:** Exploratory Data Analysis<br />
**Question 2:** Fitting the Multiple Linear Regression Model<br />
**Question 3:** Checking for Outliers and Multicollinearity<br />
**Question 4:** Checking Model Assumptions<br />
**Question 5:** Partial F test<br />
**Question 6:** Reduced Model Residual Analysis and Multicollinearity Test<br />
**Question 7:** Transformation<br />
**Question 8:** Model Comparison<br />
**Question 9:** Estimation and Prediction<br />
