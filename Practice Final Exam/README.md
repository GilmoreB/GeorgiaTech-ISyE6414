### This is a PARTIAL practice exam, used to prepare for full exam 1.

**Data** <br />

The data analyzed in the first part of the exam came from a sample of flights leaving the Atlanta Airport in the year 2015.


**Variables**<br />

The response variable is ‘DEPARTURE_DELAY’ which is a continuous variable indicating the number of minutes a flight was delayed note that there are negative values, indicating that the flight in question actually departed early.

The predicting variables are as follows:

DAY_OF_WEEK integer value for day of the week (Sunday=1, Monday=2, …, Saturday=7)
AIRLINE factor variable for each airline (AA = American Airlines, AS = Alaska Airlines, DL = Delta, F9 = Frontier Airlines, MQ = American Eagle, NK = Spirit Airlines, OO = SkyWest Airlines, UA = United Airlines, US = US Airways, WN = Southwest Airlines)
DESTINATION_AIRPORT factor variable for destination airport (unique 3 letter code for each airport; ie ATL is Atlanta, SFO is San Francisco, LGA is LaGuardia)
SCHEDULED_DEPARTURE scheduled departure time, in military time as HHMM (so 1:45pm will appear as 1345)
SCHEDULED_ARRIVAL scheduled arrival time, in military time as HHMM (so 1:45pm will appear as 1345)
DISTANCE distance of flight in miles

**Questions**<br />

**Question 1:** Multiple Linear Regression Model Fitting<br />
**Question 2:** Stepwise Variable Selection<br />
**Question 3:** Recreate Model after Variable Selection<br />
**Question 4:** Outlier Analysis<br />
**Question 5:** Recreate the model after Variable Seletion and Outlier Removal<br />
**Question 6:** Goodness of Fit<br />
**Question 7:** Confidence Interval<br />
**Question 8:** Conclusion<br />
