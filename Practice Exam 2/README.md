### This is a PARTIAL practice exam, used to prepare for full exam 2.

**Data** <br />
The data analyzed in this part of the exam came from medical patients who have suffered from a heart attack within the last year.


**Variables**<br />
Response Variable: still alive

Explanatory Variables:
* age -- age in years when heart attack occurred
* pericardial_effusion-- Pericardial effusion is fluid around the heart. This is a binary variable: 0=no fluid, 1=fluid.
* fractional_shortening -- a measure of contractility around the heart. Lower numbers are increasingly abnormal
* lvdd -- left ventricular end-diastolic dimension. This is a measure of the size of the heart at end-diastole. Large hearts tend to be sick hearts
